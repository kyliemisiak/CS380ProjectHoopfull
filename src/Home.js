        <p1>I wanna be the very best
        Like no one ever was
        To catch them is my real test
        To train them is my cause
        I will travel across the land
        Searching far and wide
        Teach Pokemon to understand
        The power that's inside
        Pokemon!
        Gotta catch 'em all--
        It's you and me
        I know it's my destiny
        Pokemon!
        Ooooh, you're my best friend
        In a world we must defend
        Pokemon!
        Gotta catch 'em all--
        Our hearts so true
        Our courage will pull us through
        You teach me and I'll teach you
        Pokemon!
        Gotta catch 'em all!
        Gotta catch 'em all!
        Yeeaa.
        Every challenge along the way
        With courage I can face
        I will battle everyday
        To claim my rightful place
        Come with me the time is right
        There's no better team
        Arm in arm we'll win the fight
        It's always been our dream
        Pokemon!
        Gotta catch 'em all--
        It's you and me
        I know it's my destiny
        Pokemon!
        Ooooh, you're my best friend
        In a world we must defend
        Pokemon!
        Gotta catch 'em all--
        Our hearts so true
        Our courage will pull us through
        You teach me and I'll teach you
        Pokemon!
        Gotta catch 'em all!
        Gotta catch 'em all!

        Gotta catch 'em all!
